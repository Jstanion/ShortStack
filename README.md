## Description
Short Stack is a social platform that caters to developers or anyone in the tech community, providing them with a space to share short-form videos on tech insights and interesting techniques. Our motivation for creating "Short Stack" was to encourage users to share valuable, short videos that others can learn from. Additionally, users are able to create their own accounts where they can connect with other users and share their passion for technology and development.
